      <p>A pithy saying is worth its weight in gold.</p>
      <p>Don't wear roller skates to a tug-of-war.</p>
      <p>Don't let it get to you. Shout happens.</p>
      <p>A journey of a thousand miles continues with the second step.</p>
      <p>It's okay to be wrong temporarily.</p>
      <p>Even egotists are allowed to have opinions.</p>
      <p>You're flame-proof in the same sense that certain plastics are fluorine-proof.</p>
      <p>I have many friends who question authority. For some reason most of 'em<br />
      limit themselves to rhetorical questions.</p>
      <p>Many folks want nothing more than to live and let learn.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I wish I could put an expiration date on my quotes.</p>
      <p>I've decided I don't want to be a manager. Every time you try to be<br />
      responsive to your employees, they say you're being reactive and not<br />
      proactive. And when you try to be proactive, they accuse you of<br />
      being capricious and arbitrary. So I don't wanna be a manager... </p>
      <p>I'm sorry, but you just made me lose my sense of humor, which is deeply<br />
      regrettable.</p>
      <p>Just because you're into control doesn't mean you're in control.</p>
      <p>If you only have a nail, you tend to see every hammer as a problem.</p>
      <p>You can only measure the size of your head from the inside.</p>
      <p>It's easier to make up sayings people like to hear than sayings they<br />
      like to heed.</p>
      <p>A good messenger expects to get shot.</p>
      <p>The social dynamics of the net are a direct consequence of the fact<br />
      that nobody has yet developed a Remote Strangulation Protocol.</p>
      <p>That which does not kill me makes me stranger.</p>
      <p>It's ironic that you would use a language as large as English to express<br />
      so small a thought.</p>
      <p>Hey, I like C too, and have written uglier programs than that.</p>
      <p>You need to go and find someone to teach you the rudiments of irrational<br />
      discourse.</p>
      <p>I can only bend the rules so much before it starts looking like I'm breaking<br />
      the rules.</p>
      <p>Just because something is obviously happening doesn't mean something obvious<br />
      is happening.</p>
      <p>If ease of use is the highest goal, we should all be driving golf carts.</p>
      <p>All things are proceeding rapidly to their contusion.</p>
      <p>New versions happen.</p>
      <p>If it makes goo on the windshield, we'll call it a bug.</p>
      <p>Just because my fingers are in my ears doesn't mean I'm ignoring you.</p>
      <p>Oh, I'm totally outrageous--I just never seem to inspire any outrage. :-)</p>
      <p>Historically speaking, the presence of wheels in Unix has never precluded<br />
      their reinvention.</p>
      <p>Some people think abstraction makes things easier, while others think it<br />
      makes things harder. It all depends on what you think are things.</p>
      <p>To claim any more than that is to invite a religious war, which I ain't.<br />
      Go thou and don't likewise.</p>
      <p>I will always write it the second way, so if you're optimizing for<br />
      contrariness, it's obviously better to do it the first way.</p>
      <p>The purpose of most computer languages is to lengthen your resume by<br />
      a word and a comma.</p>
      <p>Most of what I've learned over the years has come from signatures.</p>
      <p>Yes, you can think of almost everything as a function, but this may upset<br />
      your wife.</p>
      <p>Winter is worth its wait in cold.</p>
      <p>Nowadays people just don't distinguish between prudence and paranoia.</p>
      <p>&quot;Lurking&quot; is one metaphor that the Omniscience has allowed us to borrow.</p>
      <p>Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal with fingernail clippings mixed in.</p>
      <p>The young think they are immortal, and are determined to prove otherwise.</p>
      <p>That's okay. Anyone whose opinion he cares about already knows that<br />
      he doesn't care about their opinion.</p>
      <p>111% of crap is everything.</p>
      <p>It's later than you don't think.</p>
      <p>Have the appropriate amount of fun.</p>
      <p>Any computer scientist who praises orthogonality should be sentenced to<br />
      use an Etch-a-Sketch.</p>
      <p>For it, that's now.</p>
      <p>The usability of a computer language is inversely proportional to the<br />
      number of theoretical axes the language designer tries to grind.</p>
      <p>Programmers are almost as good at reading documentation as they are<br />
      at writing it.</p>
      <p>Yes, Perl is specialized. It's specialized for slinging around crap.<br />
      Of course, as T. Sturgeon points out, 90% of everything is crap.</p>
      <p>Tonight I just can't face the Muzak.</p>
      <p>If you don't like the way I drive, stay out of the kitchen.</p>
      <p>Your friend is your enemy, and your enemy is your friend.</p>
      <p>Perl is such a great deal because a lot of people have worked a great deal<br />
      on it.</p>
      <p>This needs to be thunk through.</p>
      <p>People who test their limits sometimes find their limits.</p>
      <p>For any computer language X, we find that X has no clothes.</p>
      <p>If something is different, it's either better or worse, and usually both.</p>
      <p>When you think you're at the end of your rope, check again. You may<br />
      actually be at its beginning.</p>
      <p>You can solve any problem by adding a level of indirection--except the<br />
      problem of having too many levels of indirection.</p>
      <p>Any technology sufficiently advanced is indistinguishable from a Perl script.</p>
      <p>My life's ambition is to be buried in the tomb of the unknown comedian.</p>
      <p>Do you rant and rave, or do you cant and cave? Myself, I slant and slave...</p>
      <p>I wanted Perl to work smoothly in the way that natural languages work<br />
      smoothly, not in the way that mathematics works smoothly.</p>
      <p>A wise man once said absolutely nothing, but apparently he only said it once.</p>
      <p>Think global, act loco.</p>
      <p>A dyslexic Greek thinks he has a broken right hand.</p>
      <p>The trouble with being quoted a lot is that it makes other people think<br />
      you're quoting yourself when in fact you're merely repeating yourself.</p>
      <p>Your world, and welcome to it.</p>
      <p>&quot;Welcome to *my* parlor,&quot; said the fly. &quot;Shall we quote the quotidian?&quot;</p>
      <p>The misery of getting older is that your fire no longer grows to accomodate<br />
      the number of irons you put into it.</p>
      <p>I burn my bridges at both ends.</p>
      <p>They who go down to the C in chips...</p>
      <p>The light at the end of your tunnel is me coming the other way.</p>
      <p>Ignorance is bliss only as long as you keep your mouth shut.</p>
      <p>Being an adult isn't about being grown up--it's about realizing you<br />
      need to grow up.</p>
      <p>It is always difficult to approach one's own crucifixion with equanimity.</p>
      <p>There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and cute sayings like<br />
      this one.</p>
      <p>Only a scientist could persist in believing that data are a count noun.</p>
      <p>Hopefully it's better in the ways that it's different.</p>
      <p>Perl isn't like a hammer. It's more like a Sears.</p>
      <p>With that sort of allergic reaction you're better off avoiding Perl.<br />
      Ah, well. Myself, I have to avoid wheat, eggs, seafood and tomatoes.</p>
      <p>There's no accounting for immune systems.</p>
      <p>Language design is 10% science and 90% psychology.</p>
      <p>The usefulness of a language is not primarily constrained by what is<br />
      possible. Shell scripts tend to be possible, but improbable.</p>
      <p>The problem with the bottom line is that there's more than one of it.<br />
      Every spreadsheet has a different opinion.</p>
      <p>I don't believe everything I read, nor half the stuff I write.</p>
      <p>That's about as funny as muppet Norwegian.</p>
      <p>The presence of naysayers does not imply that the yeasayers are right,<br />
      or vice versa.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't be so uptight if you weren't so downloose.</p>
      <p>Vigor is more useful than rigor, unless you're already dead.</p>
      <p>Maybe we can fix reality one of these days.</p>
      <p>There's only one speed limit for starships.</p>
      <p>If the syntax of Perl seems arbitrary, it's because I'm the arbiter.</p>
      <p>I'm not insane, I'm exsane.</p>
      <p>Ignorance flows like water, but knowledge must be pushed.</p>
      <p>The road to heaven is paved with good extensions.</p>
      <p>He who hesitates is bossed.</p>
      <p>Skip breakfast. It makes it easier to believe six impossible things.</p>
      <p>As we approach year 2000, we are discovering the anatomy of future shock.<br />
      Overstimulation leads to oversimplification, which leads to overreaction.<br />
      The quest for individual sanity leads to collective psychosis.</p>
      <p>I admire your powers of oversimplification...</p>
      <p>I'd say that again, but it'd probably land right on top the first one.</p>
      <p>Hey, what am I doing in this lurch again?</p>
      <p>If all you have is a Sears, everything starts looking like a DIY project.</p>
      <p>How do you know you slept like a log? Maybe you slept like a cabbage, or<br />
      a cribbage board, or a steam calliope.</p>
      <p>Neologisms, archeologisms, orthologisms and heterologisms are all<br />
      acceptable here, as long as we understand each other. You grok?</p>
      <p>Icon is a cat language, and Perl is a dog language.</p>
      <p>Q: How many Perl programmers does it take to change a light bulb?<br />
      A: How many ways do you want it done?</p>
      <p>The phrase &quot;over my dead body&quot; appears to be more and more likely.</p>
      <p>Some people seem to have trouble with the fact that certain things that<br />
      are obvious to them aren't at all obvious to me.</p>
      <p>Garbage collection is misnamed. It should be called &quot;Make your mother<br />
      pick up after you.&quot; This explains why CS students like it.</p>
      <p>Whatever I do first, nothing else gets done.</p>
      <p>Companies with too much marketeering put out crap. Companies with too<br />
      much engineering never put out anything. The most successful products<br />
      are about 90% crap.</p>
      <p>If a lot of things are starting to look like nails, maybe you're a<br />
      carpenter.</p>
      <p>The only thing we have to be paranoid about is paranoia itself.</p>
      <p>The paranoia a government inspires is proportional to the paranoia<br />
      within the government. And vice versa.</p>
      <p>If you wait long enough, someone else makes the coffee.</p>
      <p>Wake up and smell the toffee.</p>
      <p>I've written some scripts that work in 582 different languages, all of<br />
      them named &quot;shell&quot;.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I think I think sideways.</p>
      <p>To answer some questions, a Boolean value is too complicated.</p>
      <p>I'm not smart enough to be happy about thinking that hard.</p>
      <p>When you rewrite a compiler from scratch, you sometimes fix things you<br />
      didn't know were broken.</p>
      <p>Those who learn from history are doomed to have it repeated to them anyway.</p>
      <p>Genies and worms have much in common, when it comes to containers.</p>
      <p>It would be difficult to construe this as a feature.</p>
      <p>If you and I always agree, then one of us is redundant.</p>
      <p>The problem with TECO is that it's hard to distinguish the loops from<br />
      the HTML tags.</p>
      <p>Usenet was not designed to stop you from saying stupid things, because<br />
      that would also stop me from saying clever things.</p>
      <p>Most of the slopes in the world are not slippery. People walk them up<br />
      and down all day long, quite on purpose.</p>
      <p>Many are chilled, but few are frozen.</p>
      <p>Usenet is essentially Letters to the Editor without the editor.<br />
      Editors don't appreciate this, for some reason.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, closemindedness is taught more often than it is learned.</p>
      <p>Being famous has its benefits, but fame isn't one of them.</p>
      <p>Some people think metaphors are the cell bars. I think they're the<br />
      spaces between the bars.</p>
      <p>Economists all think alike in all the wrong ways. As do computer scientists.</p>
      <p>The intentionality of an organization is inversely proportional to its size.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I was overly paranoid, but the &quot;underly&quot; paranoid get deselected.</p>
      <p>Reductionists prefer symmetry, and get annoyed when something fits like<br />
      a glove.</p>
      <p>People are going to think Kibo and I are married, the way we keep<br />
      getting mentioned in the same sentence.</p>
      <p>Sometimes martyrdom is obligatory.</p>
      <p>Yes, but I think he's closer to the other end of the gift horse.</p>
      <p>You can be blissfully ignorant, or you can be intentionally ignorant,<br />
      or you can confuse the two like most people.</p>
      <p>Don't assume that I'm ever entirely serious or entirely joking.</p>
      <p>There are two kinds of people--those who believe they understand<br />
      statistics, and those who think they understand statistics.</p>
      <p>You can either value truth above ego, or ego above truth.</p>
      <p>Most parents worry about who their kids will want to marry. I worry more<br />
      about who will want to marry my kids.</p>
      <p>Scheme is a church organ, Perl is a theatre organ.</p>
      <p>Just because Perl is the melting pot of computer languages doesn't mean<br />
      you have to stir.</p>
      <p>Efforts to maintain the &quot;purity&quot; of a language only succeed in establishing<br />
      an elite class of people who know the shibboleths. Ordinary folks know<br />
      better, even if they don't know what &quot;shibboleth&quot; means.</p>
      <p>Part of managing your own ego is knowing when to let others manage it.</p>
      <p>Most computer languages fail by taking a good idea and driving it into<br />
      the ground.</p>
      <p>Computers are supposed to serve man, not vice versa, the experience of<br />
      the last 40 years notwithstanding.</p>
      <p>Ignorance of the law is durn near mandatory these days.</p>
      <p>Perhaps someone should invent strongly-typed mathematics so that<br />
      mathematicians can no longer make mistakes.</p>
      <p>You know you've got a real problem when the name you drop is your own.</p>
      <p>The quality of this mercy is severely strained.</p>
      <p>It's not impossible. Not many things are.</p>
      <p>Perl is not really uglier than csh--it only looks uglier.</p>
      <p>Hey, if it gets the job done, I can keep a straight face, briefly.</p>
      <p>Unix has a dang lot of computer science mixed in with the crap.</p>
      <p>Your taxonomy is overtaxed.</p>
      <p>This isn't rocket science. Or if it is, we're getting better at rockets.</p>
      <p>You're much more likely to be knocked down by a snowball than by an equivalent<br />
      number of snowflakes.</p>
      <p>Psychology's no good if you can't use it on yourself.</p>
      <p>I'm always amazed at how many people expect to be both elitist and<br />
      populist simultaneously.</p>
      <p>To design a pretty language, study math. To design a practical<br />
      language, study geography.</p>
      <p>We invented the notion of culture several million years ago. Overall,<br />
      it seems to have been a useful concept.</p>
      <p>What I tell you three times is hype.</p>
      <p>Learn the difference between expressing yourself and impressing others.</p>
      <p>I view a programming language as a place to be explored, like Disneyland.</p>
      <p>What we have here in this newsgroup is a failure in crowd control.</p>
      <p>Reading the FAQ is like staying in line--it's something you should<br />
      learn in kindergarten. Usenet needs a better kindergarten.</p>
      <p>As long as Perl remains the Most Fun of All Computer Languages, I'm not<br />
      worried about the competition.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence makes mistakes too, only faster.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to make yourself unforgetable. And you can just<br />
      forget about most of 'em.</p>
      <p>Build a better diplodocus, and the world will beat a path to the mouse.</p>
      <p>Evolution always rationalizes after the fact. The fact that people do<br />
      the same is not entirely a coincidence.</p>
      <p>I don't really care how the current C standard defines it--they can<br />
      always redefine it. I don't imagine comp.std.c was created merely to<br />
      maintain the status quo.</p>
      <p>I'd rather be remembered than merely not forgotten.</p>
      <p>There is no entirely satisfactory solution to the problem of progress.</p>
      <p>There are many ways to define &quot;better&quot;, but there are even more ways to<br />
      define &quot;worse&quot;.</p>
      <p>Comparing languages is a lot like comparing wives.</p>
      <p>People often confuse user-friendly with nonuser-friendly.</p>
      <p>It's better that Perl be hated by those who don't know the language<br />
      than by those who do.</p>
      <p>Please don't ask me what I think, or I'll contradict myself.</p>
      <p>Psychology is the study of why we call our lucky shots &quot;good&quot;, and<br />
      our bad shots &quot;unlucky&quot;.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Perl is the language of choice for net abuse.</p>
      <p>This may seem a bit weird, but that's okay, because it is weird.</p>
      <p>Pascal's a great language, if you like training wheels on a moped.</p>
      <p>I don't care whether people actually like Perl, just so long as they *think*<br />
      they like it. ;-)</p>
      <p>Don't get brainwashed by your education into thinking that all the<br />
      answers have to come from teachers.</p>
      <p>Perl 5 will be POSIX compliant, for some definition of POSIX and some<br />
      definition of compliant.</p>
      <p>There are two ways to measure greatness. One is by how many people<br />
      you've influenced. The other is by how many people you've helped.</p>
      <p>One of the oddest things about human nature is that someone who says<br />
      &quot;I couldn't disagree more&quot; will in fact continue to disagree more. :-)</p>
      <p>The human condition would be easier to take if it weren't so unconditional.</p>
      <p>Escape from legalism is no excuse for lack of grace.</p>
      <p>I no longer go out of my way to avoid offending imaginary people.<br />
      I get enough grief from real people.</p>
      <p>It's a pity that nautical metaphors are out of style, since &quot;bilgewater&quot;<br />
      so perfectly describes some Usenet postings.</p>
      <p>I won't stand for it and I won't take it lying down. I guess the only thing<br />
      left is to sit it out.</p>
      <p>A lot of people who think they have back trouble really have front trouble.</p>
      <p>There's much to be said for that point of view, and you seem to be<br />
      saying all of it.</p>
      <p>The problem with schools today is that they're teaching our kids<br />
      everything that will get them disqualified from juries.</p>
      <p>By and large, I try not to do anything unless I have several reasons<br />
      to do it. (But they don't all have to be good reasons.)</p>
      <p>I don't know about you, but I'd much rather be contradicted when I'm<br />
      wrong than when I'm right. My wife would contradict me, of course.</p>
      <p>Next time you feel like relying on the legal system, just remember that half<br />
      the lawyers in this country are paid to see that justice doesn't prevail.</p>
      <p>Writing is the process of banging your head against a block of marble<br />
      until everything that doesn't look like an elephant is what's left.</p>
      <p>Perl was specifically designed to evolve over time. Just because it has<br />
      evolved as far as it has doesn't mean I think it's perfect yet.</p>
      <p>Well, the creation date does exist in Unix, but only at the moment the<br />
      file is created. The problem is that it goes away immediately. :-)</p>
      <p>: It's too bad Larry Wall is dead. Did you know that he used to search the<br />
      : entire newsfeed for his name using an Awk script?<br />
      I knew it in a former life.</p>
      <p>: How about &quot;living legend&quot;?<br />
      Considering the alternative, I'll go for that. :-)</p>
